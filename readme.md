# Awesome scratch pads

Scratch pad implementation similar to i3wm scratchpad for AwesomeWM.

## Why build this

Because I was so used to i3wm scratch pad and couldn't find something
similar for AwesomeWM.

## Caveats

Current implementation uses tag 9 as the scratch workspace, So
whatever you push to the tag 9 manually will also toggle on and off
when toggling scratch pad
